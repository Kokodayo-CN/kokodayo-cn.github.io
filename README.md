To whomever is reading this line, welcome!

This is the repository for my personal web portal, with links to my social media accounts, and will act as a remote portal for my home assistant server once configured properly.  
This is my first time creating and publishing a website, so don't mind it looks hanky and out of touch.  
Anyway, thanks for visiting!

# To whomever *i*s reading this line, *w*elcome!  
This is the repository for my person*a*l web portal, with li*n*ks to my social media accoun*t*s, and will act as a remote port*a*l for my ho*m*e assist*a*nt server once configured properly.  
  
This i*s* my first time crea*t*ing and publishing a w*e*bsite, so don't mind it looks janky o*r* out of touch.

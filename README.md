# To whomever is reading this line, welcome!
This is the repository for my personal web portal, with links to my social media accounts, and will act as a remote portal for my home assistant server once configured properly.  
This is my first time creating and publishing a website, so don't mind it looks janky and out of touch.  
Thanks for the amazing [step-by-step guide by Github](https://github.com/skills/github-pages) on creating and personalizing Github Pages website, [detailed documentation](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) for customizing minima theme by the Jekyll team, and countless guides and posts on Stack Overflow.  
**Anyway, thanks for visiting!**

# To whomever is reading this l*i*ne, welcome!
This is the repository for my personal *w*eb portal, with links to my social medi*a* accounts, and will act as a remote portal for my home assista*n*t server once configured properly.  
*T*his is my first time cre*a*ting and publishing a website, so don't *m*ind it looks j*a*nky and out of touch.  
Thank*s* for the amazing [step-by-step guide by Gi*t*hub](https://github.com/skills/github-pages) on cr*e*ating and personalizing Github Pages website, [detailed documentation](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) fo*r* customizing minima theme by the Jekyll team, and countless guides and posts on Stack Overflow.  
**Anyway, thanks for visiting!**
